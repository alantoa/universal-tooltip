# Working on poppo

An Expo module: anchored popups (tooltip, popover) plus a toast manager, for
iOS, Android and web. Published on npm as `poppo`; it was `universal-tooltip`
through 1.x, and `alias/universal-tooltip` is the shim that keeps the old name
installing. `src/` is the JS surface, `ios/` is Swift, `android/` is
Kotlin, and `example/` is a playground app that doubles as the test bed.

This file records what is **not** discoverable by reading the code — the
platform behaviour the implementation is shaped around, and the invariants that
break silently when violated. Everything else, read from the source.

## Commands

```sh
yarn lint                       # eslint (src only)
yarn test                       # jest: the toast manager's schedule (see below)
npx tsc --noEmit                # library
npx tsc --noEmit -p example/tsconfig.json
yarn build                      # tsc to build/ + copy the css (does NOT clean; see below)

cd example
yarn start                      # Metro
yarn ios                        # or yarn android
yarn test:ios                   # XCUITest suite; starts Metro itself if needed
```

Two build steps have non-obvious prerequisites, both of which fail with errors
that do not name the cause:

- Gradle needs `ANDROID_HOME`, or it reports "SDK location not found":
  `cd example/android && ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
- `pod install` needs a UTF-8 locale, or CocoaPods dies inside
  `unicode_normalize` with `Encoding::CompatibilityError`:
  `cd example/ios && LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 pod install`

`yarn test` is deliberately **not** on the `expo-module-scripts` jest preset:
that preset needs `babel-preset-expo` and `expo` at the package root, which
this library does not otherwise depend on. It is plain `ts-jest` in a node
environment instead, and it needs no mocks because the only thing it imports is
`src/toast-manager.ts` — pure JS, no react-native. Anything that renders a
component will need the real preset (and `babel-preset-expo` plus `expo` at the
package root) first. Note that `expo-modules-core` and `react-native-reanimated`
both publish untranspiled TypeScript, and jest transforms nothing under
`node_modules`, so an import graph that reaches either one has to mock it.

`yarn build` compiles without cleaning, so files deleted from `src/` linger in
`build/`. That does not reach npm — `prepublishOnly` runs `expo-module clean`
first — but do not trust `build/` after deleting a source file. `yarn clean`
first. `yarn prepare` is **not** a build: in expo-module-scripts 56 it is a
noop that prints a warning, so a `build/` holding only `styles.css` means
nothing has been compiled. And `expo-module build` is bare `tsc`, which is why
`build` and `prepublishOnly` both chain `yarn copy-files` — the web entry
imports `./styles.css`, and without the copy the published package breaks on
web only.

## The JS ↔ native contract

A popup renders one of two ways, chosen by what is inside `<Popup>`:

- **String children** → drawn natively from props (`text`, `textStyle`,
  `containerStyle`). `Popup` returns `null`, so **no popup child is mounted at
  all**.
- **Anything else** → rendered by React Native inside the native popup window.

For the second path, `Popup` mounts two nested views, and native finds them by
`nativeID` (never by child index — Fabric does not guarantee mount order):

- `universal-tooltip-content` — the **slot**: absolutely positioned and as wide
  as the window. It is a measuring box, not the bubble. Yoga measures an
  absolute child inside its containing block, so a slot left to hug a 68pt
  trigger would wrap a `maxWidth: 260` bubble into a narrow column.
- `universal-tooltip-body` — the **bubble**: hugs its content. Its frame is what
  native positions, sizes and points the arrow at.

The slot is always laid out, open or closed. Sizing it from a JS `onLayout`
round trip instead was the original cause of iOS popups opening as a bare arrow
in the wrong place: the measurement could not settle while the slot was
collapsed.

Both platforms take over React's child bookkeeping so the slot can live outside
the anchor view — `reactChildren` on iOS, a `GroupView` definition on Android.
If you add a child to the anchor, it must go through those.

## Platform behaviour that shaped the code

**`ExpoView` on Android extends `LinearLayout`.** Anything that triggers its
measure/layout — a `requestLayout` override, calling `super.onLayout` — runs
LinearLayout's horizontal arrangement over children that React positions
itself, and shifts them. This is why `UniversalTooltipView` no-ops both
`onMeasure` and `onLayout`. Symptom when it regresses: triggers pushed sideways
out of their container by the width of a sibling.

**Expo re-applies the whole prop map on every transaction.** `finalizeUpdates`
in `ExpoFabricViewObjC.mm` iterates all props and calls every setter — there is
no diffing. So `OnViewDidUpdateProps` fires constantly, and anything expensive
behind it needs its own change check (both platforms compare a "chrome
signature" before re-laying out).

**Fabric never recycles Expo views.** `ExpoFabricView.shouldBeRecycled()`
returns `false`, so `prepareForRecycle` is dead code. The reachable teardown
hook is `invalidate`, which React calls on every unmounted view that skips the
pool. Its default lives in a `UIView` category that Swift cannot see, so it is
implemented as `@objc func invalidate()` with **no** `override` and no `super`
call.

**React's iOS views never consume UIKit touches.** They observe them through a
gesture recognizer, so a press on popup content walks up the responder chain
and reaches the overlay too. Anything the overlay does in `touchesEnded` must
first check the touch against the bubble's frame, or pressing the popup's own
content dismisses it.

**Where a popup ends up is decided differently on each platform, and both had
holes.** iOS computes the frame itself in `placement(for:source:in:)`; Android
hands the job to Balloon's `showAlign*`. The rules now match: the chosen side,
then the opposite one, then — for `left`/`right` only — `bottom` and `top`, so a
bubble with room on neither side lands above or below its trigger instead of off
the display. iOS also clamps both axes as a last resort; the cross axis was
always clamped, and the main axis only ever bites when no side had room at all.

Two things about the Android half are easy to get wrong again:

- `Balloon.getMeasuredWidth()` **returns 0 until the popup has been shown.**
  Using it for the room check made the check pass every time and the fallback
  dead code — the symptom was a fix that looked right and changed nothing. The
  host is measured directly instead.
- The arrow is padding on the host (`TooltipRootViewGroup.setArrow` calls
  `setPadding`), so it is already inside the measured size: the room check adds
  only `sideOffset`, not `sideOffset + arrowHeight`. And because that padding
  decides which edge the arrow grows from, the arrow has to be re-pointed at
  `shownSide` after the side is resolved — `side` is what JS asked for,
  `shownSide` is what it opened on, and everything that draws or follows must
  use the latter.

`setMarginHorizontal` used to be switched off for horizontal sides, which is
exactly what let a `right` bubble sit flush against the edge with no room to
breathe. It is unconditional now: that margin is how Balloon slides a popup
inward at a display edge.

**Balloon's arrow is a square `ImageView`** driven by one `setArrowSize`, so it
cannot express a 14×8 triangle. Android disables it and draws bubble, corners
and arrow in `TooltipRootViewGroup`, positioning the arrow after the window is
up — that is the only moment Balloon's edge clamping is knowable.

## The toast stack

The toasts are **absolutely positioned and overlapping**, each anchored to the
same viewport edge — not children of a flex column. That is the whole reason the
stack is stable: a toast finishing its exit animation frees no slot, so nothing
it was sitting next to moves. A column had the opposite property, and the bug it
produced is worth remembering — anchored to the bottom, a plain column gave the
edge slot to the *oldest* toast, so a replacing toast was laid out one bubble
too high and dropped as the toast it replaced animated out.

Depth comes from the manager's order: `getToasts()` is newest-first, so a Root
counts the entries ahead of its own id. It counts only the ones that are **not**
closing, which is what makes the stack feel right — a toast gives up its place
the moment `close` runs, so the ones behind it spring forward while it is still
fading instead of waiting for `finalize`. Each step back peeks `stackPeek` past
the toast in front and is `stackScaleStep` smaller, with `minStackScale` as a
`maxVisible` slots: past the last one a toast parks in that slot and fades out
there rather than climbing further from the edge, which is what keeps a long
run of toasts a stack rather than a ladder — and what stops the scale from
running down to nothing. `transformOrigin` is pinned to the anchored edge —
scaling about the default centre would drift the edge the stack aligns on.

The two rules with any real logic in them — `stackDepthOf` (who is in front,
skipping the ones leaving) and `stackSlotOf` (which slot, and whether it is
buried) — live in `src/toast-manager.ts` as pure functions so the jest suite
covers them. Keep them there: everything left in the worklet is arithmetic.

The enter/exit is deliberately asymmetric, following
[rnmotion.dev's spring toast](https://rnmotion.dev/animations/spring-toast):
the entrance springs in from `ENTER_OFFSET` past the edge at `HIDDEN_SCALE`,
while the exit is a fixed 160ms bezier that fades and sinks. Running the
entrance backwards would make a toast dismissed mid-spring leave at whatever
speed the spring happened to be at.

Consequences worth knowing before changing any of it:

- The viewport **fills** its parent rather than hugging its toasts. An absolute
  child's insets are measured from the padding box, so padding on the viewport
  would not move the toasts; the edge spacing lives on each Root instead, which
  is why `ToastViewportGeometry` carries resolved `edgeMain`/`edgeLeft`/
  `edgeRight` rather than the raw insets.
- `zIndex` is explicit (`STACK_Z - index`). Children render front-first, so
  without it the toasts behind would paint over the front one.
- Toasts of different heights make a slightly ragged stack, because nothing
  clamps a background toast to the front one's height. sonner does clamp, which
  needs a measure pass. Nothing dims by depth either — the reference animation
  does not, and the cap keeps the raggedness to two background cards.
- Only the front toast takes the pan gesture (`.enabled(… && isFront)`) — the
  ones behind it are covered, so a drag there would be a drag on something the
  user cannot see.
- Two axes dismiss, and they are not symmetric: sideways works either way, but
  vertically only the toast's own edge is a way out, so the other direction
  goes through `resist()` and asymptotes instead of following the finger. A
  diagonal flick that clears both thresholds goes with the axis the finger
  travelled further along.
- `swipedAxis` is how the exit knows what it is finishing: 0 for a timeout or
  the close button (sink `EXIT_DROP`), 2 for an edge swipe (sink further), 1
  for sideways (do not sink at all — the toast is already leaving along X, and
  adding a drop reads as it falling over).

## Opening the stack

**Unverified as shipped.** On Android a tap was seen to clear the stack instead
of opening it, and the cause was never found; on iOS the scaffolding for a
visual check never landed a tap on the right button. The prop is off by default
and marked experimental in the README for that reason — do not treat the
described behaviour below as observed.

`expandable` puts a `Gesture.Tap` on each Root, composed as
`Gesture.Exclusive(pan, tap)` so a drag never doubles as a tap. It is enabled
only while more than one toast is up — a lone toast with a button in it should
never have its press competing with an expand.

That competition is the reason `expandable` is off by default: a GH tap on the
wrapper and an RN `Pressable` inside the toast both see the same touch, and
both fire. There is no way to ask GH "did a child handle this?", so the
documented answer for interactive toasts is to leave the tap off and drive
`expanded` yourself.

Opening out needs **measured heights**: collapsed, a fixed `stackPeek` is
enough because the toasts overlap, but open they have to clear each other.
Each Root reports its own height from `onLayout` into the viewport's registry
(and `null` on unmount, or the map grows for the life of the app);
`stackOffsetOf` turns that into a distance from the edge. A toast whose height
has not arrived yet contributes nothing and lands on the one in front until it
does.

Opening does **not** reveal what `maxVisible` hid — what opens out is the stack
as drawn. A buried toast stays faded and stays unreachable by the pan.

## Reanimated and Gesture Handler

Both are peer dependencies, and only the toast needs them. The anchored popups
animate natively on iOS/Android and through Base UI on web.

- Reanimated 4 needs `react-native-worklets` as well, and its babel plugin.
  `babel-preset-expo` adds `react-native-worklets/plugin` on its own when
  worklets is installed, so the example's babel config says nothing about it.
- Gesture Handler needs `GestureHandlerRootView` at the root of the app on
  Android. The example wraps in `App.tsx`.
- **Velocity units differ from PanResponder.** `PanResponder`'s `vx`/`vy` are
  points per *millisecond*; Gesture Handler's `velocityX`/`velocityY` are per
  *second*. The swipe threshold went from `0.5` to `500` for that reason —
  carrying the old number over makes every flick a dismissal.
- Worklets need stable callables, so the Root keeps its changing closures in one
  `actions` ref and hands `runOnJS` thin wrappers that never change identity.

`createToastManager` lives in `src/toast-manager.ts`, apart from the components
in `src/toast.tsx`, precisely so the jest suite can import the scheduler without
pulling in react-native, Reanimated or Gesture Handler. Keep it that way: the
suite needs no mocks at all, and that is what keeps it off the jest-expo preset.

## The toast viewport's window overlay

`<Toast.Viewport presentation="window" />` is iOS-only, and exists for one
reason: React Native's `Modal` presents a view controller, so UIKit adds its
transition view to the same window and an inline viewport ends up underneath.

`ToastOverlayView` handles it the way `RCTModalHostView` handles a modal's own
content, and the way `UniversalTooltipView` already handles a popup: the React
children are moved out into a container added straight to the window, with one
`RCTSurfaceTouchHandler` attached to that container so touches still reach JS.
Two details are load-bearing:

- **The overlay is attached late, and re-attached on every new toast.**
  `addSubview` appends, so the last view added is frontmost. That is the entire
  mechanism by which a toast beats an already-open modal — no higher
  `windowLevel` is involved. The known gap: a modal presented *while* a toast
  is showing covers it until the next toast raises the overlay again. Closing
  that gap properly means a dedicated `UIWindow` above `.alert`.
- **The slot is given the window's size from JS.** The host view is 0×0 — its
  children live elsewhere and it must not disturb the layout around it — and
  Yoga measures an absolute child inside its containing block, so a slot left to
  inherit would collapse. `useWindowDimensions()` feeds it, which also
  re-renders on rotation.

The container hit-tests its subviews directly instead of calling `super`, so a
toast mid-swipe past the container edge stays pressable while misses fall
through to the app. The slot must keep `pointerEvents: "box-none"`, or a
full-window transparent view eats every touch on the screen.

`ToastOverlayView` is registered as a **second** `View` in
`UniversalTooltipModule` and must stay after the first: expo-modules-core makes
`viewDefinitions.first` the module's default view, which is what
`requireNativeViewManager("UniversalTooltip")` resolves to. This one is
addressed by `ViewName("ToastOverlay")`.

Android has no permission-free equivalent — its `Modal` is a `Dialog` with its
own window, so being above it means attaching to whichever window is topmost and
following it as modals open and close. The viewport stays inline there, and
`presentation="window"` warns once in `__DEV__`.

## Verifying a change

Screenshots are not enough for anything touch-related; drive it.

- **iOS**: `cd example && yarn test:ios`. There is no tap injection available
  otherwise — `simctl` has no input command, and controlling the simulator
  window from outside needs Accessibility permission that a CLI agent will not
  have. The suite covers the paths only a real touch reaches, and it has caught
  a real bug that every screenshot pass missed.
  Leaving the previously installed runner on the simulator makes the run
  execute the **previous** build of the tests — a silent way to "verify" code
  that is no longer there, and it cost real time before it was spotted. The
  script uninstalls the runner before and after every run for that reason; if
  you invoke `xcodebuild test` by hand, do the same, and sanity-check with
  `strings <...>.xctest/<binary> | grep testYourNewName` when a result looks
  impossible. The runner also dies instantly if launched from the home screen
  ("Library not loaded: @rpath/XCTest.framework/XCTest") — expected, not a
  crash in the example.
  Two environment traps, both of which make **every** test fail before the
  first assertion:
  - The script boots the *newest* iPhone when none is booted. On an iOS 27
    beta runtime the example dies at launch with `SIGTRAP` in
    `__UIApplicationEvaluateRuntimeIssueForNoSceneLifecycleAdoption` — the
    app has no scene manifest and that runtime treats it as fatal. Pass
    `SIMULATOR_UDID=<an iOS 26 or 18 device>`.
  - The script reuses whatever answers on :8081, and Metro cannot tell whose
    project it is. Another repo's `expo start` there means the example loads
    the wrong bundle. Do not kill it: start this Metro on another port and
    point the installed app at it, no rebuild needed —
    `cd example && npx expo start --dev-client --port 8082`, then
    `xcrun simctl spawn <udid> defaults write expo.modules.universaltooltip.example RCT_jsLocation "localhost:8082"`
    (and `defaults delete` it afterwards, or `yarn ios` will look on 8082).
- **Android**: drive it with `adb shell input tap`, and screenshot with
  `adb exec-out screencap -p`. Reset the scroll position first (the list drifts
  between runs) and confirm the app is actually foreground — a stray tap on the
  home screen launches something else and the rest of the run is garbage.

## Repo traps

The npm name is `poppo`, but every native identifier still says
`UniversalTooltip`: the Expo module name (`requireNativeViewManager(
"UniversalTooltip")`), the pod, the Kotlin package `expo.modules.universaltooltip`,
the `universal-tooltip-*` nativeIDs, the example's bundle id. That is deliberate.
None of it is user-visible, and renaming it means touching Swift, Kotlin,
`expo-module.config.json`, the example's Xcode project and the XCUITest runner
id in one go, for nothing. Do not "tidy" it piecemeal — a half-renamed module
fails autolinking with no useful error.

`.gitignore` once listed bare `example/ios` and `example/android`, which hid
real sources: this package's own `TooltipRootViewGroup.kt`, the example's
`MainActivity.kt` and `AppDelegate.swift`. A directory-level exclude cannot be
narrowed afterwards, because git will not descend into it to find a negation.
Name generated paths, never a directory that also holds sources.

The compound parts (`Positioner`, `Popup`, `Arrow`) are read off the elements
written inside `Root`. They cannot be wrapped in a user component — React has
not rendered it yet, so there is no output to read. That is a real constraint,
not an oversight; `Root` warns in `__DEV__` when it finds no `Popup`.
